To run the server, follow these installation steps:

Install Node.js:

Download and install Node.js from here. This will also install npm, the Node.js package manager.
Install MySQL (or any SQL database that your project uses):

Install MySQL from here.
You can also use a cloud database if you prefer.
Backend:Express

Install Dependencies:

Inside the project folder (where your package.json file is located), run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file (like express, sequelize, bcryptjs, etc.).

Configure Environment Variables:

Make sure you create and configure a .env file in the root directory of the project.
It should contain at least these two variables:
plaintext
Copy code
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
Setup Database:

Make sure MySQL (or the database you're using) is running.
Configure the database connection in your project (likely in a file like db.js or similar).
Run database migrations if your project uses Sequelize (optional, depending on your project):
bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
Start the Server:

Finally, start the server with the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:8000.
